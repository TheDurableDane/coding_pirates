# coding_pirates

## Purpose
This repository contains short scripts that will introduce novice programmers to key programming topics. It is aimed at children/teenagers and might be used for Coding Pirates---a Danish organization. The general idea is to introduce concepts like for-loop, branching, strings, integers, arrays, etc. in a fun way that is not solely about learning those concepts, i.e. the purpose of introducing the for-loop is not to introduce the for-loop but rather to make the computer repeat a task.
