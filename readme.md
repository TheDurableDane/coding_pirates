# coding_pirates
The content of this repository is my private collection of samples that are useful for introducing Python. It is in principle completely unrelated to the organization Coding Pirates.

## Purpose
This repository contains short scripts that will introduce novice programmers to key programming topics. It is aimed at children/teenagers and might be used for Coding Pirates---a Danish organization. The general idea is to introduce concepts like for-loop, branching, strings, integers, arrays, etc. in a fun way that is not solely about learning those concepts, i.e. the purpose of introducing the for-loop is not to introduce the for-loop but rather to make the computer repeat a task.

## Content
* Dice roll: random numbers, plotting
* Game of Life: if-else, functions, arrays, plotting
* ASCII: strings, lists, for-loops, if-else
* Image to text converter: imports, RGB, images, read/write to file, nested loops, if-else
