# coding_pirates
The content of this repository is my private collection of scripts that are useful for introducing Python. It is in principle completely unrelated to Coding Pirates.

## Purpose
This repository contains short scripts that will introduce novice programmers to key programming topics. It is aimed at children/teenagers and might be used for Coding Pirates -- a Danish organization. The general idea is to introduce concepts like loops, branching, strings, integers, arrays, etc. in a fun way that is not solely about learning those concepts, i.e. the purpose of introducing the for-loop is not to introduce the for-loop but rather to make the computer repeat a task.

## Content
* Dice roll: random numbers, plotting
* Game of Life: if-else, functions, arrays, plotting
* ASCII: strings, lists, for-loops, if-else
* Image to text converter: imports, RGB, images, read/write to file, nested loops, if-else
* Hangman: while-loop, functions, nested loops/if-else, user input
* Guessing a string: random numbers, strings, for-loop, while-loop
* Sum of natural numbers: for-loop, functions, recursion (careful!)
* Square root: functions, math, while-loop, print formatting
* Computing pi: for loops, functions, lists, plotting, mathematics
